```
read {image.png or image.jpeg}

This reads an image consisting of ranks,
usernames and results and converts it to a csv
file and google sheets. Additionally it will 
inform you about usernames that it thinks the
ocr engine might have messed up. An example of
what this image should look like is in the
attached thumbnail to the right.

    example: !read {standings.png}
    - Reads the attached image of usernames

    Image Format:
    rank  username   x - y
    rank  username   x - y
    rank  username   x - y
    rank  username   x - y

    Results have 4 possible comments
    - no comment --> name matches existing
                     user 100%
    - FIXED --> name matched existing user
                75-99% so bot changed it
    - MIXED --> name could be multiple users
    - CHECK --> bot may have made a mistake, requires review```
