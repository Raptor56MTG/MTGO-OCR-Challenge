```I am Text Image Bot! I convert mtgo images into text to help you 
collect data. Here are my commands and their parameters:

1. read
    - Reads an image consisting of mtgo usernames and records (x-y)
    and converts it to a csv formatted to the data collection sheet.
    Additionally sends a link to a google sheet with this data for
    easy copy paste abilities.

2. readfull
    - Currently in the works. Ideally reads an entire screenshot
    from an MTGO challenge and parses matchup info.

3. help
    - Displays the helpful message you are currently seeing.


Type !help {command} for more info on a command.```
